I’m an AI researcher interested in understanding higher-order cognitive functions and developing AI systems that replicate them. I’m also interested in building a mathematical framework that links structural motifs in neural connectivity to functionality, through the lens of dynamics.

Currently, I’m a Master’s student at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en){:target="_blank"}  and [Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/){:target="_blank"}, supervised by [Guillaume Lajoie](https://www.guillaumelajoie.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Dhanya Sridhar](https://www.dsridhar.com/){:target="_blank"}. My research explores how compression functions as a unifying principle underlying various functionalities in both artificial and biological systems, from perception to abstract reasoning. Specifically, I investigate how principles of compression can induce compositional structure in learning systems, enabling robust and efficient generalization.

Previously, I interned as a Machine Learning Engineer at Intellisports Inc., where I focused on human activity recognition using sequence models. I also worked at [MiQ](https://www.wearemiq.com/){:target="_blank"}, building scalable machine learning pipelines within a big data framework. 

Aside from research, I enjoy chess, climbing, snowboarding and playing football.
