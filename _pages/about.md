I'm an AI researcher interested in understanding high-order cognitive functions and developing AI systems that replicate them. I am also interested in developing a mathematical framework that links structural motifs in neural connectivity to functionality, through the lens of dynamics. 

Currently, I'm a master's student at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en){:target="_blank"} and [Universite de Montreal](https://www.umontreal.ca/){:target="_blank"} under the supervision of [Guillaume Lajoie](https://www.guillaumelajoie.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Dhanya Sridhar](https://www.dsridhar.com/){:target="_blank"}. My research explores how compression functions as a unifying principle underlying various funcitonalities in both artifical and biological systems, from perception to abstract reasoning. Specifically, I investigate how compression plays a central role in systems with compositional structure, enabling robust and efficient generalization.

Previously, I have interned as a Machine Learning Engineer at Intellisports Inc., focusing on human activity recognition using sequence models. I have also worked on big data, building machine learning pipelines at [MiQ](https://www.wearemiq.com/){:target="_blank"}. Outside of research, I enjoy chess, climbing, snowboarding and playing football.
