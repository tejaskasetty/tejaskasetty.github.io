I am an AI researcher interested in understanding higher-order cognitive functions and in developing learning systems that reflect the structural principles underlying human intelligence.

I am currently a Master’s student at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en){:target="_blank"}  and [Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/){:target="_blank"}, supervised by [Guillaume Lajoie](https://www.guillaumelajoie.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Dhanya Sridhar](https://www.dsridhar.com/){:target="_blank"}. My research explores compression as an important organizing objective in intelligent systems, and how it shapes representation, abstraction, and generalization. In particular, I study how compression-driven learning objectives can induce compositional structure, encourage the reuse of learned components, and give rise to algorithmic behavior in models trained on structured data. I am especially interested in how data organization and learning curricula influence what models learn and how efficiently they can generalize.

Previously, I interned as a Machine Learning Engineer at Intellisports Inc., where I worked on human activity recognition using sequence models, and at [MiQ](https://www.wearemiq.com/), where I developed scalable machine learning pipelines in large-scale data environments.

Outside of research, I enjoy chess, climbing, snowboarding, and playing football.
